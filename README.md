# Minesweeper
Throwback to the classic game of minesweeper.  
Click the squares, avoiding the randomly hidden mines. Green squares are mine free.  
If you click a mine, it's game over!  
Additional logic to be developed to place numbers indicating how many mines there are in the neighbouring squares, as in the original game.  

Built during week 5 of _nology course, using jQuery, HTML & CSS. No additional packages require to run locally.
